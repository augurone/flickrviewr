Flickr Image Viewer by [Chad Augur](http://codepen.io/augur) 
------------------
## Task at Hand
Create a web page that shows a grid of photo thumbnails; when a thumbnail is clicked, the photo should be displayed in a lightbox view, with the ability to move to the next / previous photos and display the photo title.

- Access a public API and successfully retrieve data from it;
- Display that data on a page;
- Update the UI of a page without refreshing;
- Build a polished user experience you'd be proud to ship; and
- Do all of the above using only native JavaScript (no libraries such as jQuery, although CSS preprocessors are fine)

## Techinical Choices

- Decided to use the tokenized Flickr API
- K.I.S.S. plain HTML, CSS, JS delivery
- Use Codepen as dev environment versus setting up and entire build environment for this purpose. 
  - Used LESS, and autoprefixer
  - No external JS dependencies I did not write.
- Challenged myself to use as few classes as possible
- All Semantic tags

## How to use?
- From a local repository open index.html in the browser. 
- Can be deployed as is to existing webdirectory.
